function [angleArray, meanAngles] = makeAngleArrayV(x, y)

%MAKEANGLEARRAY Get tangent angles for each frame of normBlocks and rotate
%               to have zero mean angle
%
%   [ANGLEARRAY, MEANANGLES] = MAKEANGLEARRAY(X, Y)
%
%   Input:
%       x - the x coordinates of the worm skeleton (equivalent to
%           dataBlock{4}(:,1,:)
%       y - the y coordinates of the worm skeleton (equivalent to
%           dataBlock{4}(:,2,:)
%
%   Output:
%       angleArray - a numFrames by numSkelPoints - 1 array of tangent
%                    angles rotated to have mean angle of zero.
%       meanAngles - the average angle that was subtracted for each frame
%                    of the video.

% of atan which uses the range -pi/2 to pi/2.

% to pi and pi to -pi.  In these cases, subtract 2pi and add 2pi
% respectively to all remaining points.  This effectively extends the

% when we subtract off the mean.

% more than pi from one segment to the next)
